* Up to this point I have not found any major bugs. There are extensive tests inside the unit
directory which is currently stored in the /apps directory. 

* Each of the unit tests makes its own disk with a different name since it is difficult 
todo unit tests when there are unexpected changes made to the same disk. The test01.c and test02.c
use the vdisk file. 

* Even though all of the tests use InitLLFS at the start
of the test for unit testing purposes, it is also possible to use llfs_load
which brings all of the data from the disk such as block map and inode map into memory.

* Also, in the journal file there are a couple unimplemented functions. This is simply because
I originally had more plans for checksums and stuff but ran out of time. I left them there simply because I might finish them in the future.

**All of the tests can be run by doing "make run" in the apps directory**

* The file_disk generated by the test_file.c program generates a good
example of nested documents, reading and writing to nested files, reading and
writing to files in root and generates large files using single and double
indirect blocks

* A disk must be mounted first using the disk_mount function

* Also when looking at the block map for each byte they reserve blocks
from right to left. So the bytes are still traversed from left to right
but the bits inside the block are reserved from right to left.
